# Rubik's Cube Timer

This was a project I made during freshman year of high school. It is a lightweight timer app designed to track and improve your Rubik's Cube solving times.

## Features
- **UI/UX-Oriented** - Simple and intuitive interface with clear prompts for how to time your solves.
- **Scramble Generator** - Create randomized scramble sequences for realistic practice.
- **Competition-Style Timing** - Functions like an official competition timer to allow a seamless transition to real-world events.
- **Best and Average Times** - Displays personal bests and calculates average solve times.
- **Solve History** - Keep track of previous solve times to track progress.

## Technologies Used
This app was built using:
- **HTML** for structuring the web interface.
- **JavaScript** for functionality, event handling, and data storage.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.

## How to Use
1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Scramble the cube according to the random sequence shown on the top of the screen.
3. Press and hold the spacebar until the text prompt appears, then release to start the timer.
4. Press any key to stop the timer once you finish the solve.
5. View your recorded times and track your progress over multiple attempts.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing cloud storage to save solve history across sessions.
- Adding support for different puzzle types (e.g., 2x2, 4x4, Pyraminx).
- Supporting dark mode for better user experience and accessibility.
- Adding inspect mode to simulate 15-second inspection time in official competitions.
